                            <p>A cornea transplant is an operation to remove all or part of a damaged cornea and replace it with healthy donor tissue. 
							A cornea transplant is often referred to as keratoplasty or a corneal graft. It can be used to improve sight, relieve 
							pain and treat severe infection or damage. One of the most common reasons for a cornea transplant is a condition 
							called keratoconus, which causes the cornea to change shape.</p>
							<p>The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball. It acts as a window to the eye. The coloured iris 
							and the pupil (the black dot in the centre of the iris) can be seen through the cornea. The cornea helps to focus 
							light rays on to the retina (the light-sensitive film at the back of the eye). This "picture" is then transmitted to the brain.
							When the cornea is damaged, it can become less transparent or its shape can change. This can prevent light reaching the 
							retina and causes the picture transmitted to the brain to be distorted or unclear.</p>
