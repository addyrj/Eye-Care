                            <p>Most children scheduled for eye surgery are ASA Class I or II and can be managed as day cases. Anaesthesia is usually straightforward; however, in some children, the eye problem may be part of a chromosomal or metabolic disorder with anaesthetic implications. In many cases, the associated anomaly is limited to developmental delay, mental retardation and behavioural problems and the challenge lies in managing these patients in a sympathetic manner. In others, the association may be of more direct anaesthetic relevance.
