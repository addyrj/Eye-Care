                            <p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has grown to be a clinical standard of care for the assessment of ocular structure since becoming commercially available more than a decade and a half ago. OCT is based on the principles of interferometric detection, in which light echoes backscattered from the retina interfere with light that has traveled to a reference mirror at a known time delay. Echoes from a single point on the retina represent an axial scan (A-scan), and optical cross-sections (B-scans) are obtained by scanning the OCT beam in the transverse direction.
